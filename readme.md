Welcome to the discord repository of peregrine (version 2.0)!

<br/>

You can run this bot manually with `main.py`, but we highly reccomend you use Docker!

To run the bot:
- Download Docker
- Clone this repository to your local filesystem (pre-built image coming soon)
- Fill in `.env`
- Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to build and run the image


(Almost all functionality in this bot is hardcoded to roles in the langara computer science club discord. Fork the bot if you want to use it in another server!)

Contact Highfire1#1942 if you have questions about the bot!

More functionality coming soon™️
